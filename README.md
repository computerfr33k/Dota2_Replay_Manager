Dota2_Replay_Manager
====================
This program allows you to manage all of your downloaded dota 2 replays by naming them to what whatever you like.
And also shows the stats for that game (Only works for games that are in the Dota 2 WebAPI).

_Development status is currently on hold._

(Please let me know if you would like me to continue development.)
