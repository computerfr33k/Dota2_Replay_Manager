Development is currently on hold right now due to financial & school reasons. I cannot afford to spend anytime on this project at this time since I have put in countless hours with no financial return. Since there has been no financial return I also do not know how many people genuinely find this software useful, plus it is hard to be unemployed and working on software for free, and to also be a full-time college student.

So please, if you truly want to see this project move forward please consider dropping at least a few dollars as little bit helps, not to mention it also costs me money to keep this site up & running each and every month.
