<li>Goto your dashboard and click on 'keystore', create key, select computerfr33k/Dota 2 Replay Manager from the dropdown, and name the key for what helps you identify the key.</li>
<li>Open my program and goto settings->preferences, enter in your api key, and then select where your replays are located then click ok.</li>
